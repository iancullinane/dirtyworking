						<h2 class="about_titles">The Dirty Dream</h2>
						<p>As far back as macaroni necklaces and popsicle sticks, I have always made gifts for my friends and family. Be it Christmas, Valentine’s Day, or birthdays, I make it a point to handcraft something special for my loved ones, based on their personalities and interests. After a successful run of seven years in TV production, I was feeling creatively unsatisfied. I decided it was time to get back to basics, and pursue that which has given me so much happiness of the years; creating gifts. Personalized products which would be appropriate for any occasion; the celebration of a birth, the joy of a wedding, or that moment you decide to give a loved one a gift “just because.” And Dirty Soap was born.</p>

						<p>Our soaps make great, personalized gifts for any occasion, in some of those most unique shapes on the market. Our most popular items include The Dirty Dessert Line, which features soap in the shapes of your favorite tasty treats; donuts, cupcakes, ice cream sandwiches... If you mistake them for the real thing, it wouldn’t be the first time. Dirty Soap also offers soaps tailored to your favorite colors and scents.  Tell us about the person receiving the gift, and we’ll work with you to make sure we deliver a product perfect for your recipient.</p>

						<p>But that's not all. My dirtiest bars are 100% all natural, completely handmade from scratch, and contain all natural oils. They are light and summery and perfect for both men and women. </p>
